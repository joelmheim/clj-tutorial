# Clojure Workshop EDC 2019

Welcome to this short workshop and introduction to the Clojure programming language.

The main idea is that we are going to explore the language together independent of our starting point. Some of you are already familiar with functional programming and others even with one or more of the other Lisps out there, and some are perhaps new to both.

Therefore I have provided a set of resources and some suggested tasks for you to get started. I make a quick introduction to the language and the environment, and then help you select your path for the rest of the workshop.
